# Skillings.Mack.Suppress

> "A generalization of the statistic used in Friedman's ANOVA method and in Durbin's rank test. This nonparametric statistical test is useful for the data obtained from block designs with missing observations occurring randomly. A resulting p-value is based on the chi-squared distribution and Monte Carlo method." - Patchanok Srisuradetchai


## Changes

This repository is a small update to the [Skillings.Mack](https://github.com/cran/Skillings.Mack "Skillings.Mack CRAN Mirror") package with the purpose of providing more options for outputting the results. The original options would print the following;

```{r data, results='hide', echo=FALSE}

some_matrix <- matrix(
   c(3.2,4.1,3.8,4.2,		3.1,3.9,3.4,4.0,	 4.3,3.5,4.6,4.8, 
     3.5,3.6,3.9,4.0,   3.6,4.2,3.7,3.9,   4.5,4.7,3.7, NA,
	   NA ,4.2,3.4,NA ,   4.3,4.6,4.4,4.9,   3.5, NA,3.7, 3.9),
    ncol=9,byrow=FALSE)

```

```{r example_original, results='hide'}
Ski.Mack(some_matrix, simulate.p.value = TRUE, B = 1000)

```

[![Original](README_files/original.png)](https://github.com/ZacWarham "Go to author's page")

Whilst useful, if you were to assign the result to a variable you would still have the same output in your console or markdown. By adding a new parameter, `suppress = TRUE`, this reduces the output to just the test statistics results like this;

[![Surpressed](README_files/suppressed.png)](https://github.com/ZacWarham "Go to author's page")

This is particularly useful when trying to knit a document with a very large matrix or if you have to run similar tests multiple times. Instead of hiding the entire output, you just see the test statistics results. Please note, this only reduces the output when you assign the result to a variable.

A further addition was to include the *p-value* and *Simulated p-value* in the output list so they can be accessed when stored in a variable.

```{r example_pvalue_display}
some_result <- Ski.Mack(some_matrix, simulate.p.value = TRUE, B = 1000, suppress = TRUE)

some_result$pValue
some_result$pValueSim
```

## Installation

This package can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/ZacWarham/Skillings.Mack) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ZacWarham/Skillings.Mack")

library(Skillings.Mack.Suppress)
```

Once installed this release should be fully compatible with all working code from the original release. To reduce the output you just need to add the `suppress = FALSE` parameter. Both additional values should automatically be included in any assigned variables. Make sure to detach the library and load `Skillings.Mack.Suppress` first. If there are any problems please create an issue in this repository.
